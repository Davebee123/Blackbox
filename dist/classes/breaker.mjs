// Breaker subclasses, the engine side: what the subclass skills, talents and edges do, and how
// the planner plays them. The data (skills, trees) is in ./breaker.data.mjs.
//
// Every hook is optional, and runs for every player in every fight: gate each one on the player's
// class or subclass (subOf, subEdge, hasTalent, rank). combat.mjs calls them (see CLASS_HOOKS there):
//   use[id](s, ctx)        after the generic part of a skill resolves. ctx: { a, id, target, to, res, base, intent, auto, e }
//                          (to: the ally an `ally: true` skill was aimed at, else s)
//   validate[id](s, intent) a reason the skill can't be used now, or null
//   start(s)               a fight starts (also for crewmates)
//   cycle(s)               the end of this player's turn each cycle (after burns and helpers)
//   dealt(s, p, opts)      a multiplier on damage this player deals to part p (opts.mine, opts.dot)
//   taken(s, atk, p)       a multiplier on an attack's damage to this player
//   crit(s, p, opts)       extra crit chance (percent) on a hit
//   cooldown(s, id, cd)    the cooldown to use instead of cd
//   hit(s, p, res, opts)   after a hit lands (res.dealt, res.crit, res.broke)
//   broke(s, p)            this player broke part p
//   struck(s, atk, dealt, p) an attack landed on this player
//   plan(s, t)             a command for the planner (bots, crewmates, balance scripts), or null to fall through
